# Blue Team Detection Engineering Lab

**Project Idea:** Developing, testing, and tuning security detection logic for common cloud threats using AWS native logging services. Focus on identifying lateral movement and data exfiltration indicators.

**Status:** Defining a baseline of normal activity and beginning to write custom log-based detection queries (e.g., in Splunk or AWS Athena).

**What it will demonstrate:**
* Practical experience with **CloudTrail** and **GuardDuty** for security monitoring.
* Ability to translate threat intelligence into actionable detection rules (Detection-as-Code).
* Hands-on use of SIEM/log analysis tools for **threat hunting**.
* Knowledge of common cloud adversary techniques and MITRE ATT&CK Cloud Matrix.
